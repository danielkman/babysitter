# Unified Stack Architecture

→ [Documentation Index](README.md) | Related: [Glossary](glossary.md) | [Stack Guide](stack-guide.md)

## Purpose

This document explains how the already-unified Babysitter and adapters stack fits together in the current monorepo. It is a map of today's executable system, not a promise of a larger future decomposition.

## Architecture Stance

The current stack has one strong center and several supporting seams:

- `@a5c-ai/babysitter-sdk` remains the orchestration core.
- `@a5c-ai/babysitter` and `@a5c-ai/genty-platform` provide the operational CLI and runtime surfaces.
- `packages/adapters/*` provide the dispatch layer for harness-facing agent execution.
- `@a5c-ai/hooks-adapter-cli`, `@a5c-ai/extensions-adapter`, and `@a5c-ai/tasks-adapter` are focused support subsystems that normalize hooks, compile plugins, and route human approvals.
- `plugins/babysitter-unified/` is the canonical plugin source, while per-harness plugin bundles remain the user-installable outputs.

This is a unified executable stack with explicit package families, not a promise that every family must become its own larger platform.

## Responsibility Map

The architecture is easiest to reason about as five package families that meet at the orchestration core.

### 1. Orchestration Core

Owned primarily by:

- `packages/babysitter-sdk`
- `packages/babysitter`
- `packages/genty/platform`

This layer owns runs, replay, task definitions, journal/state handling, hooks dispatch, profiles, process-library bindings, and the CLI commands that operate on those concepts.

### 2. Dispatch Layer

Owned primarily by:

- `packages/adapters/core`
- `packages/adapters/adapters`
- `packages/adapters/cli`
- `packages/adapters/sdk`
- `packages/adapters/gateway`
- `packages/adapters/harness-mock`
- `packages/adapters/observability`

This layer knows how to talk to different harnesses and normalize them into a shared agent-running contract. It is complementary to Babysitter rather than a replacement for it: Babysitter orchestrates process execution; adapters dispatches and normalizes harness interaction.

### 3. Cross-Harness Support Systems

Owned primarily by:

- `packages/adapters/hooks/*`
- `packages/extensions-adapter`
- `packages/tasks-adapter`

These packages solve cross-cutting problems:

- `hooks-adapter` normalizes hook events and adapter wiring.
- `extensions-adapter` compiles one canonical plugin description into harness-specific outputs.
- `tasks-adapter` routes human approvals and structured breakpoint responses.

This support layer is part of the delivery path for metaplugins on legacy non-Babysitter agents, but it is not the metaplugin abstraction itself. Metaplugins sit one level higher: they package reusable capability concerns across plugin and hook surfaces. `extensions-adapter` emits the concrete bundles those concerns need, while unified plugin sources such as `plugins/babysitter-unified/` provide one first-party authoring surface for that delivery.

### 4. Distribution And Installation Surfaces

Owned primarily by:

- `plugins/babysitter-unified`
- `plugins/babysitter-*`

The important distinction is:

- `plugins/babysitter-unified/` is the canonical authoring surface.
- `plugins/babysitter-codex`, `plugins/babysitter-gemini`, and similar directories are the concrete installable bundles and compatibility surfaces.

### 5. User Experience Surfaces

Owned primarily by:

- `packages/adapters/tui`
- `packages/adapters/webui`
- `packages/adapters/ui`
- `packages/adapters/mobile-*`
- `packages/adapters/tv-*`
- `packages/adapters/watch-*`
- `docs/`, `docs-site/`

These packages are consumers of the orchestration and dispatch layers. They are not the architectural center of V6, but they are part of the stack and need coherent ownership boundaries.

## Package Family Map

| Family | Primary paths | What it owns now | What it does not imply |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orchestration core | `packages/babysitter-sdk`, `packages/babysitter`, `packages/genty/platform` | Run lifecycle, replay, storage, task dispatch, CLI/runtime surfaces | A future forced split into many more top-level runtime packages |
| Dispatch family | `packages/adapters/*` | Harness invocation, adapter normalization, gateway, shared interaction contracts | Replacement of Babysitter orchestration |
| Support adapter family | `packages/adapters/hooks/*`, `packages/extensions-adapter`, `packages/tasks-adapter` | Hook normalization, bundle compilation, human approval routing | A formal "platform layer" that already has independent product boundaries |
| Distribution surfaces | `plugins/babysitter-unified`, `plugins/babysitter-*` | Canonical plugin authoring plus harness-specific installable outputs | One single bundle format with no compatibility constraints |
| User surfaces | `packages/adapters/ui`, `packages/adapters/webui`, `packages/adapters/tui`, `docs-site/` | Human-facing interaction, visualization, docs, and operator surfaces | Ownership of orchestration semantics |

## Operational Path Through The Stack

The end-to-end diagram above is the shape. The live execution narrative is:

1. A concrete harness installs or loads a plugin bundle under `plugins/babysitter-*`.
2. Those bundles are compiled from `plugins/babysitter-unified/` by `packages/extensions-adapter`, with `packages/adapters/hooks/*` normalizing hook behavior where the harness model requires it.
3. The installed bundle reaches the operational runtime in `packages/babysitter` and `packages/genty/platform`.
4. That runtime delegates the core orchestration work to `packages/babysitter-sdk`, which owns run directories, journal/state replay, effect requests, process-library binding, and workflow execution.
5. When a workflow requires a reusable process, the runtime reaches into `library/` or project-local `.a5c/processes/`.
6. When a workflow requires human approval routing, `packages/tasks-adapter` handles that concern as a distinct subsystem instead of burying it inside generic hook language.
7. When the system needs adapter-level dispatch or richer interaction surfaces, `packages/adapters/*` carries that responsibility without changing the orchestration center of gravity.

## Integration Contracts That Matter

### Babysitter ↔ Harnesses

Harnesses are reached through plugin bundles, lifecycle hooks, and session binding behavior. This is where `plugins/*`, `hooks-adapter`, and harness-specific install surfaces matter.

### Babysitter ↔ Agent-Adapter

The key boundary is orchestration versus dispatch:

- Babysitter owns process execution, runs, replay, and effect lifecycles.
- adapters owns adapter-level normalization, event streams, invocation modes, and harness interaction surfaces.

### Unified Plugin ↔ Per-Harness Bundles

The unified plugin is the authoring source. Per-harness bundles are the compatibility outputs. V6 should describe both, not collapse them into one concept.

### Orchestration ↔ Human Approval

Breakpoint routing is a distinct concern. `tasks-adapter` should be discussed as a supporting subsystem for approvals rather than folded into generic hook or session language.

### V6 ↔ Validation

The current executable seam contract is validated at the repo level through:

- `npm run verify:v6:seams`

That command matters because V6 is supposed to promote real seams with active checks, not only naming changes in design docs.

## What Is Normative Now

- The monorepo already contains Babysitter, adapters, hooks-adapter, extensions-adapter, and tasks-adapter.
- `packages/babysitter-sdk` is still the main center of gravity.
- adapters is already integrated as repo content, workspace packages, and documentation.
- Unified plugin authoring coexists with per-harness plugin bundles.
- Metaplugins are a current capability-layer concept over plugin and hook surfaces, with `extensions-adapter` serving as the concrete bundle compiler for legacy non-Babysitter agents.
- `npm run verify:v6:seams` is the active repo validation cue for the first executable V6 seam contract.

## What Is Deferred

- Any forced rename from current packages into a new runtime/platform/application stack.
- Any claim that the adapter support packages must become a larger formal platform before their current seams are proven.
- Any architectural story that assumes remote, distributed, or strongly isolated plugin execution by default.
- Any claim that documented placeholder seams such as `packages/transport-adapter` are already cut over into the active runtime.

## Validation And Honesty Cues

When a section in this document makes a structural claim, check it against three concrete surfaces:

- **Repo paths**: the relevant package or plugin directory must already exist.
- **Validation commands**: the claim should connect to active checks such as `npm run verify:v6:seams` and, when broader package-boundary honesty matters, `npm run test:architecture`.
- **Placeholder docs**: if a seam is still aspirational, its docs should say so explicitly, as `packages/transport-adapter/README.md` and `packages/transport-adapter/architecture.md` currently do.

## Reading Rule

If a design discussion makes the stack sound cleaner than the current repo, check whether it is:

1. a real package/path in this monorepo,
2. a current V6 commitment, or
3. only deferred vocabulary.

If the answer is only "vocabulary", it is not yet architecture.
