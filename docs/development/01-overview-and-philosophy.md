# a5c: Overview & Development Philosophy

## What is a5c?

a5c is an agent orchestration platform that enables any coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Pi, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, etc.) to execute structured processes — from simple CI tasks to complex multi-phase development workflows. It unifies the fragmented landscape of coding agents behind a single launch, orchestration, and observability surface.

## Core Principle: Ontology-Driven Development

The platform is built on a knowledge graph (atlas) that models every agent, capability, provider, transport, hook surface, and plugin target as interconnected nodes with typed edges. Development decisions are driven by the graph, not by hardcoded if/else chains:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Knowledge Layer"
        ATLAS["Atlas Graph<br/>(YAML → JSON index)"]
        CATALOG["Agent Catalog<br/>(query API)"]
    end

    subgraph "Evidence Layer"
        SOURCES["Source Evidence<br/>(docs, changelogs, APIs)"]
        EXPERIMENTS["Experimental Evidence<br/>(live-stack E2E tests)"]
    end

    subgraph "Runtime Layer"
        ADAPTERS["Adapters<br/>(thin wrappers, data from graph)"]
        LAUNCH["Launch<br/>(adapters launch)"]
        PROXY["Proxy<br/>(transport-adapter)"]
        HOOKS["Hooks<br/>(hooks-adapter)"]
    end

    SOURCES --> ATLAS
    EXPERIMENTS --> ATLAS
    ATLAS --> CATALOG
    CATALOG --> ADAPTERS
    CATALOG --> LAUNCH
    CATALOG --> PROXY
    CATALOG --> HOOKS
```

### Evidence Types

Every capability claim in the graph is backed by evidence:

| Evidence Type | Source | Example |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| **Source** | Documentation, changelogs, API specs | "Claude Code supports MCP" → link to docs |
| **Experimental** | Live-stack E2E tests | "Claude Code + Foundry proxy works" → CI run artifacts |
| **Inferred** | Derived from other evidence | "If supports MCP, likely supports tool use" |
| **Gap** | Known missing evidence | "Pi hook support — no docs found" |

### How the Graph Drives Code

Instead of each adapter hardcoding its capabilities:

```typescript
// OLD: hardcoded in adapter
readonly capabilities = { canResume: true, supportsMCP: true, ... };

// NEW: derived from graph
get capabilities() {
  const flags = getCapabilityFlags(this.agent);
  return { canResume: Boolean(flags.canResume), ... };
}
```

Adding a new harness means adding a YAML file to the atlas graph — not writing adapter code for every capability.

## Architecture Overview

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "User / CI"
        DEV["Developer"]
        CI["GitHub Actions"]
    end

    subgraph "Entry Points"
        ADAPTERS["adapters CLI<br/>(adapters)"]
        TRIGGERS["Triggers<br/>(GitHub Action)"]
        KRADLE["Kradle<br/>(Kubernetes operator + web UI)"]
    end

    subgraph "Orchestration"
        SDK["Babysitter SDK<br/>(run lifecycle)"]
        HOOKS["Hooks-Adapter<br/>(lifecycle normalization)"]
    end

    subgraph "Transport"
        PROXY["Transport-Adapter<br/>(protocol bridge)"]
        ENGINES["Completion Engines<br/>(OpenAI, Google)"]
    end

    subgraph "Knowledge"
        ATLAS["Atlas Graph"]
        CATALOG["Agent Catalog"]
    end

    subgraph "Agents"
        CC["Claude Code"]
        CX["Codex"]
        PI["Pi"]
        GC["Gemini CLI"]
        MORE["...8 more"]
    end

    DEV --> ADAPTERS
    CI --> TRIGGERS
    TRIGGERS --> ADAPTERS
    KRADLE --> ADAPTERS

    ADAPTERS --> CATALOG
    ADAPTERS --> PROXY
    ADAPTERS --> CC & CX & PI & GC & MORE

    CC & CX & PI --> HOOKS
    HOOKS --> SDK
    CC & CX & PI --> PROXY
    PROXY --> ENGINES

    CATALOG --> ATLAS

## Package Map

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `packages/atlas` | Knowledge graph: YAML definitions → JSON index |
| `@a5c-ai/atlas/catalog` | Query API over the atlas graph |
| `packages/adapters/cli` | `adapters` CLI: launch, install, run |
| `packages/adapters/adapters` | Per-harness thin wrappers (data from graph) |
| `packages/adapters/core` | Provider resolver, workspace service |
| `packages/transport-adapter` | HTTP proxy: protocol translation between harness ↔ provider |
| `packages/adapters/hooks` | Hook normalization: native events → canonical phases |
| `packages/babysitter-sdk` | Babysitter SDK: run lifecycle, session binding, MCP tools |
| `packages/triggers-adapter` | GitHub Action: trigger evaluation + agent dispatch |
| `packages/kradle` | Kubernetes operator + web UI for cloud deployment |
| `packages/extensions-adapter` | Plugin generator: unified source → per-harness distributions |
| `packages/genty/platform` | Standalone babysitter agent (internal harness) |

## Development Workflow

1. **Model in the graph** — Add YAML nodes/edges to `packages/atlas/graph/`
2. **Query via catalog** — Use `getAgentVersion()`, `getCapabilityFlags()`, etc.
3. **Test via live-stack** — E2E tests validate real API calls through the full stack
4. **Evidence loop** — Test results feed back into the graph as experimental evidence
