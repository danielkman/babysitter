# Agent Adapter And Runtime E2E

This strategy covers runtime paths after setup is already satisfied. It separates adapters sessions, transport carriers, genty-core programmatic sessions, and `@a5c-ai/genty-platform` orchestration. Harness/plugin install coverage lives in [Harness And Plugin E2E](./harness-e2e.md), not in agent-platform runtime E2E.

## Stack Scopes

| Scope | Packages | No-model coverage | Model-backed coverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol and event contracts | `packages/adapters/core`, `packages/adapters/gateway`, `packages/transport-adapter` | Schema, event ordering, session lifecycle, error envelopes, reconnect behavior | Real event streams from Codex and Claude Code sessions match protocol contracts |
| Adapter translation | `packages/adapters/adapters` | Prompt normalization, tool-call mapping, stop reasons, model selection, fallback behavior with mock adapters | Live Codex and Claude Code adapters translate real provider output into adapter events |
| Transport runtime | `packages/transport-adapter` | Route matrix, proxy auth, protocol codecs, runtime env injection, passthrough forwarding, subprocess lifecycle, stream cancellation, timeout/error paths, metrics/cache snapshots | Transport-adapter carries traffic for a real external harness through adapters launch and for an genty-core-backed stream |
| Agent-core bridge | `packages/genty/core` | Programmatic session creation, mock provider responses, cancellation, usage accounting | Agent-core invokes a real provider and returns events compatible with adapters and agent-platform |
| Hooks muxes | `packages/adapters/hooks/*` | Adapter normalization, hook payload fixtures, CLI execution, approval/deny/error events | Real harness hook payloads from Codex and Claude Code normalize to the same hook contract |
| Babysitter-agent runtime | `packages/genty/platform` | Seam contract, phase orchestration, planner/executor mocks, run journal state, task posting, selected backend | `agent-platform call/create-run/invoke` uses preinstalled or mocked backends; no harness install or plugin install steps are part of this E2E |
| User surfaces | `packages/adapters/webui`, `packages/adapters/ui`, `packages/adapters/tui` | Playwright/Vitest against mock gateway and fixture sessions | Optional manual/live smoke against a model-backed gateway session |

## No-Model Runtime Suite

The no-model runtime suite should be built first. It should include:

- `transport-adapter` unit and E2E tests using local HTTP/subprocess fixtures for every supported exposed transport route.
- `transport-adapter` runtime tests for `startTransportMuxRuntime`, `applyTransportMuxToHarnessEnv`, proxy auth, redacted env diffs, metrics, cache stats, passthrough path/query preservation, invalid JSON, and upstream failure mapping.
- `adapters` launch-plan tests for proxy forced, proxy if-needed, native/no-proxy, and proxy-forbidden cases so launch coverage proves the transport-adapter decision seam.
- `adapters` gateway/session tests using existing mock harness scenarios.
- Adapter translation tests for Codex, Claude Code, and genty-core-style event streams.
- `agent-platform` seam and orchestration tests with mocked planner/executor calls.
- WebUI and TUI session tests using fixture transcripts and mock gateway responses.
- Adapters plugin/session fixtures live in [Harness And Plugin E2E](./harness-e2e.md); this file consumes their event fixtures only as runtime compatibility inputs.

Candidate command grouping:

```bash
npm run test --workspace=@a5c-ai/transport-adapter
npm run test --workspace=@a5c-ai/comm-adapter
npm run test --workspace=@a5c-ai/adapters-codecs
npm run test --workspace=@a5c-ai/adapters-gateway
npm run test --workspace=@a5c-ai/genty-core
npm run test --workspace=@a5c-ai/genty-platform
npm run test:e2e --workspace=@a5c-ai/genty-web-app
```

## Transport-Adapter Coverage Matrix

Transport-adapter coverage has to prove the proxy/runtime seam directly before it is used as evidence for adapters or agent-platform paths.

### No-Model Transport Coverage

| Surface | Tests to add or keep | Required artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supported transport routes | Exercise `anthropic`, `openai-chat`, `openai-responses`, `google`, `bedrock-converse`, `azure-foundry`, `vertex-native`, and `passthrough` against fixture engines | Route transcript, response shape snapshot, invalid JSON/auth failure transcript |
| Streaming and non-streaming codecs | Verify text deltas, final events, finish reasons, usage totals, and provider-specific envelopes | Streaming event transcript and non-streaming body snapshot |
| Token and observability routes | Cover `count_tokens` success/unsupported behavior plus `/metrics` and `/cache/stats` | Token count transcript, metrics snapshot, cache stats snapshot |
| Runtime env injection | Call `applyTransportMuxToHarnessEnv` for every exposed transport | Redacted env diff proving only expected vars changed |
| Adapters launch seam | Cover `resolveLaunchPlan` for proxy forced, proxy if-needed, native/no-proxy, and forbidden proxy cases | Launch-plan JSON with `proxyNeeded`, `proxyReason`, and exposed transport |
| Passthrough forwarding | Preserve path/query/body, inject upstream auth safely, and map upstream failures | Redacted upstream transcript and failure envelope |

### Model-Backed Transport Coverage

| Path | Valid stack | Assertion focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| genty-core stream bridge | `genty-core` provider backend -> transport-adapter -> fixture consumer | Real or credential-gated stream deltas, final event, cancellation/timeout, and usage metadata survive the proxy layer |
| External harness bridge | `adapters launch <harness> <provider> --with-proxy*` -> transport-adapter -> target provider | Harness receives proxy env, provider endpoint is not called directly by the harness, sentinel prompt completes, metrics show traffic |
| Babysitter-agent precondition bridge | `agent-platform` external-harness path only when it delegates through adapters and the selected harness requires proxy translation | Transport-adapter artifacts are supporting evidence for the bridge, while Babysitter run creation/task posting remains asserted by agent-platform tests |

### Invalid Transport Claims

- Do not use transport-adapter tests to prove `babysitter harness:install` or `harness:install-plugin`.
- Do not use transport-adapter tests to prove agent-native plugin manager support.
- Do not use transport-adapter tests to prove hooks-adapter normalization.
- Do not use transport-adapter tests to prove Babysitter journal terminal state unless a higher-level runtime test also asserts that state.


### Live Install Modes

The `Publish` workflow runs external-harness live E2E through a workflow-owned install-mode axis:

- `babysitter-plugin` generates plugin artifacts, installs the target with `adapters install`, installs the local Babysitter SDK, installs the Babysitter plugin for the harness, then launches through `adapters launch` with a `/babysitter:call` prompt.
- `vanilla` installs the target with `adapters install`, launches through `adapters launch`, and uses a non-plugin prompt so it proves adapters/transport/provider behavior; the vanilla `agent-platform` rows use the `babysitter` adapter with `BABYSITTER_HARNESS=genty-core`.
- Both modes use the same target mapping: `claude-code -> claude`, `codex -> codex`, `gemini-cli -> gemini`, `pi -> pi`, and vanilla-only `agent-platform -> babysitter`.

## Model-Backed Runtime Suite

The model-backed suite should prove that real providers and real harnesses behave like the no-model contracts expect.

| Test | Required real dependency | Assertion focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transport-adapter + external harness through adapters | Claude Code or Codex-compatible harness, provider credential, and `adapters launch --with-proxy` or `--with-proxy-if-needed` | Launch starts transport-adapter, harness receives proxy env, sentinel traffic uses proxy routes, stream completes, metrics snapshot increments |
| Transport-adapter + genty-core | Provider credential for genty-core backend | Agent-core deltas/final events travel through transport-adapter without adapter-only assumptions, including cancellation or timeout evidence |
| Adapters + Codex adapter | Codex CLI or configured Codex runtime and OpenAI credential | Codex output maps to adapter protocol events, including final message and usage metadata when available |
| Adapters + Claude Code adapter | Claude Code CLI plus Foundry/OpenAI credential through transport-adapter | Claude Code output maps to adapter protocol events while model traffic is proxied to GPT-5.5, including tool-call and stop metadata when available |
| Babysitter-agent full run | Provider credentials or mocked backend already available | `agent-platform call/create-run` creates a bounded process, plans, emits a task, posts a result, completes, and records selected backend evidence without running installer commands |

Model-backed runtime tests must upload redacted event logs, provider/harness version metadata, run IDs, and command durations.

## Runtime Path Assertions

Runtime tests must declare which entry path they exercise:

| Path | Entry point | Valid backend combinations | Assertions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adapters session | `adapters run <agent>` or `createClient().run` | Mock adapter, Claude, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, OpenCode, adapters `babysitter` adapter where registered | Session start/end, event ordering, provider/model config, runtime hooks, capability-gated plugin events |
| Babysitter-agent internal runtime | `agent-platform call/create-run --harness genty-core` | genty-core backend with mocked or live model provider | Run creation, planning, task posting, terminal state, redacted model trace |
| Babysitter-agent external-harness bridge | `agent-platform call/invoke --harness <external>` | Harness names mapped in `adapterHarnessMap`; excludes `pi` and `genty-core` | Adapters mapped events, session ID, result, selected harness, no install commands |
| Transport runtime | transport-adapter around genty-core or adapters-launched external harness traffic | Local route fixture, genty-core stream, external harness stream | Route/codec contract, proxy auth, env injection, launch proxy decision, framing, reconnect, cancellation, timeout, backpressure, metrics/cache artifact |

Do not fold plugin setup into the agent-platform runtime assertions. If a runtime job needs an installed external harness or plugin, that is a precondition supplied by a setup job and recorded separately.

## Adapter-Specific Assertions

Adapter tests should assert behavior that package-local unit tests cannot prove alone:

- A session can be started, observed, cancelled, and resumed through the adapter boundary.
- Tool-call, text-delta, final-message, usage, and error events preserve ordering and session IDs.
- Adapter-specific errors are normalized before they cross gateway or transport boundaries.
- Model selection is explicit and recorded in the session state.
- Credential absence is detected before provider calls are attempted.
- Mock and live event streams conform to the same protocol fixtures.

## Babysitter-Agent Whole-System Assertions

Whole-system tests for `@a5c-ai/genty-platform` should cover:

- process loading and validation,
- run creation,
- session binding,
- planning phase output shape,
- task effect emission,
- task result posting,
- journal rebuild/repair compatibility,
- terminal run state,
- artifact and log redaction.

The no-model version should use mocks for planner and executor behavior. The model-backed version should use the smallest possible bounded process and real model credentials or a preconfigured external harness. It must not execute `harness:install` or `harness:install-plugin` as part of the agent-platform runtime test.

## Hooks-Adapter Assertions

Hooks-adapter tests should cover both adapter-local behavior and end-to-end event compatibility:

- each adapter normalizes raw harness hook payloads into the shared hook contract,
- CLI execution preserves stdin/stdout/stderr boundaries and exit codes,
- approval, denial, timeout, and malformed-payload cases are fixture-backed,
- Codex and Claude Code live hook payloads can be redacted and replayed as no-model fixtures,
- adapters UI and TUI approval surfaces consume the same normalized hook events.

Hooks-adapter live coverage should not be promoted until the no-model fixture suite covers the same event types.
