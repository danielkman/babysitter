Codex harness adapter for hooks-mux.

This package ships the built adapter runtime in `dist/` and this package README for npm publish-surface auditing.

The package exposes Codex-specific normalization, phase mappings, rendering helpers, and session-resolution utilities for the hooks-mux execution pipeline.
