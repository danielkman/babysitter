# @a5c-ai/adapters-hooks-cursor

Cursor harness adapter for hooks-mux.

## Install

npm install @a5c-ai/adapters-hooks-cursor @a5c-ai/adapters-hooks-core
```

This package ships the built adapter runtime in `dist/` and this package README for npm publish-surface auditing.

## Usage

  createAdapter,
  normalizeCursorEvent,

The package exposes Cursor-specific normalization, capability profiles, phase mappings, rendering helpers, and session-resolution utilities for the hooks-mux execution pipeline.
