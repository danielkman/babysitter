# Babysitter — Component Maturity Matrix

Components are graded by what is tested **thoroughly and automatically** — CI-gated unit/e2e tests plus the live-stack agent×model×OS matrix. A component is only graded high if its tests are *actually run and gated* by a workflow; in-tree specs that no workflow invokes do not count toward maturity.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-25

Every grade cites concrete evidence — workflow jobs, test globs, or the live QA-Evidence matrix. Where a component lacks automated test execution, it is marked lower and the gap is stated explicitly.

## Maturity levels

| Level | Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| **L0 Experimental** | No automated tests; no vitest/node:test config and zero `*.test` files. Built only as a dependency, if at all. |
| **L1 Unit-only (ungated)** | Unit/spec tests exist in-package but are **NOT** invoked by any `.github/workflows` job (no build/test step references the workspace). |
| **L2 CI-built** | Built/linted/typechecked in CI (`ci.yml` or `publish.yml` Build All / Validate job) with little-to-no unit test execution gating the workspace. |
| **L3 CI-tested** | Unit/contract and/or e2e tests for the workspace are **RUN and gated** in CI (`ci.yml` or a `publish.yml` Validate-* job invokes its test script). |
| **L4 Cross-axis-validated** | L3 **PLUS** live e2e GREEN across the relevant axis matrix (agents × modes × OS, and/or models × OS) in `live-stack`/`live-stack-published` CI. |

## Harness axis sub-table (per-agent)

Rows are the harness-dependent components (axis type "agent"). Cells reflect live-stack lane outcomes from `agentsAxis` / `QA-Evidence.md`.

| Component | claude-code | codex | pi | gemini-cli | hermes | genty | cursor | copilot | opencode | antigravity |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

Notes: `openclaw` and `oh-my-pi` have hooks adapters built in CI but no GREEN live-stack lane in the QA matrix, so they are omitted from the columns above (effectively `—`). `pi` also has one DeepSeek-V4-Pro NI Ubuntu regression (#954). harness plugins (babysitter-unified) `documented_install` is validated only for claude-code + codex; atlas-unified has no install-test gate.

[^win]: hermes is GREEN vanilla-NI on Ubuntu + macOS (gpt-5.5/mini); **Windows blocked by #856**, and sonnet blocked on credits (#485).
[^genty]: genty is GREEN vanilla-NI on all 3 OS but **only on gpt-5.5** (#936 fixed); weaker models FAIL at file-creation (#956); BI/BP modes unverified.
[^cur]: cursor-cli — SKIPPED/FAIL (#562).
[^cop]: copilot-cli — SKIPPED/FAIL (#560).
[^oc]: opencode — FAIL (Bun server lifecycle).
[^anti]: antigravity — SKIPPED (#945).

## Model axis sub-table (per-model)

Rows are the model-dependent components (axis type "model"). Cells reflect `modelsAxis` / live-stack model lanes. gpt-5.5 is the consistently-GREEN reference tier; weaker models hit the #956 file-creation ceiling (a model-adherence ceiling, not infra). genty is gpt-5.5-only.

| Component | gpt-5.5 | gpt-5.4-mini | sonnet-4-6 | gemini-3.5-flash | gemini-3.1-pro | DeepSeek-V4-Pro |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| genty-core | ✅ | ⛔ [^956] | ⛔ [^956] | ⛔ [^956] | ⛔ [^956] | ⛔ [^956] |
| adapters-codecs | ✅ | 🟡 [^956] | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 [^ds] |
| transport-adapter | ✅ | 🟡 [^956] | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 [^ds] |
| live-stack test surface | ✅ | 🟡 [^956] | ✅ | ✅ [^nong] | ✅ [^nong] | 🟡 [^ds] |

[^956]: #956 — weak-model adherence ceiling at file-creation. For genty this is a hard FAIL on every model below gpt-5.5. For non-genty agents (claude passes the identical path), it manifests as partial failures on gpt-5.4-mini, so model-axis adapters are graded green at the strong tier with the ceiling documented.
[^ds]: DeepSeek-V4-Pro is largely capped by #956 for genty; there is also one pi NI Ubuntu regression (#954).
[^nong]: gemini-3.5-flash and gemini-3.1-pro-preview are green for non-genty agents; genty FAILs (#956).

## How this was measured

Evidence sources:

- **Workflows** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `publish.yml`, `live-stack.yml`, and `live-stack-published.yml` were read to determine which packages are merely built vs. which have their test scripts actually invoked and gated.
- **Per-package tests** — vitest / node:test configs and `*.test.ts(x)` / `*.test.js` / `*.test.mjs` counts per workspace, cross-referenced against the workflow step that does (or does not) run them.
- **Live matrix** — `packages/atlas/graph/wiki/QA-Evidence.md`, the live-stack agent × mode × model × OS results (last updated 2026-06-20..06-23), for the L4 cross-axis grades.

Honesty caveats:

- **Thin SDK smoke test** — `@a5c-ai/babysitter-sdk` = `packages/babysitter` ships only **1 bin smoke test**; the real process/effect logic lives in `library/` and is validated transitively by live-stack, not by a deep dedicated unit suite.
- **Real unit suites that are ungated → L1** — several non-trivial suites are NOT invoked by any workflow step and are graded L1 despite their counts: adapters-tools (6), genty-runtime (19), genty-cli (10), genty-ui (18), kradle-web (30).
- **#956 is model-adherence, not infra** — weak-model live-stack failures are an adherence ceiling at file-creation, not a harness/infra defect; gpt-5.5 is GREEN wherever dispatched, so model-axis components are graded L4 on the strong tier with the ceiling documented.
- **Build-only packages** — adapters-config, adapters-launch, kradle-sdk, kradle-cli (L2) and the genty platform shells (L0) are built but carry no automated tests.
- **`publish.yml` adapters package-tests enumeration** runs observability/core/codecs/harness-mock/gateway/cli/sdk/channels + triggers; other adapters are build-only there.
- **`test:adapters` is known pre-broken** on the atlas build-list entry; CI relies on `build:adapters` + the per-package test enumeration instead.
